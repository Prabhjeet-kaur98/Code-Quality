# code review checklist
# No Syntax or Runtime Errors:
I check for coding errors or runtime issues in my code.
# Avoid Deprecated Functions:
I make sure I don't use outdated or deprecated functions in my code.
 # Commented-Out Code Explanation:
I provide explanations for any code I comment out. I remove unnecessary "dead code" and clearly label temporary hacks.
# Clear Comments for Files, Classes, and Functions:
I add descriptive comments at the file, class, and function levels, explaining their purpose and functionality.
# Single Responsibility Principle for Functions:
I ensure that each function I write performs a single, well-defined task. For example, if I have a function named createCustomer, it handles either creation or deletion of customers, but not both.
# Limit Function Length:
I keep my functions concise, making sure they fit within 40 lines of code or are short enough to fit on one screen without scrolling.

Although tools, design trends, and programming languages evolve over time, there is an enduring commitment to achieving excellence in software engineering and consistently producing high-quality code.Despite the evolution of tools, shifts in design aesthetics, and the ever-changing landscape of programming languages, there is a steadfast dedication to the continuous pursuit of excellence in engineering and the creation of top-notch code. these principles, and consider how and why they should all be factored into your decision-making process—no matter how big or small the decision is Maintainability,Readability,Verification and Scalability.

Clean code forms the bedrock of a sturdy and easily maintainable software system. It enhances legibility, promotes code reusability, simplifies debugging, and reduces technical obligations. Clean code doesn't just aid developers; it also exerts a favorable influence on project timelines, the scalability of the codebase, and team efficiency. Nonetheless, attaining and preserving clean code can be a formidable undertaking, particularly when projects become more intricate. This is where Exakat becomes invaluable.Exakat is a PHP-focused open-source static code analysis tool. It conducts thorough examinations of PHP codebases, detects possible problems, and provides practical suggestions for enhancing code excellence. Leveraging its wide array of analysis guidelines, Exakat empowers developers to uphold coding standards, pinpoint code issues, uncover security risks, and enhance performance.One of the key strengths of Exakat is its seamless integration with the DevOps workflow. It can be easily incorporated into continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines, allowing developers to catch code issues early in the development cycle. By integrating Exakat into the CI/CD process, teams can automate code reviews, enforce coding standards, and prevent potential bugs and vulnerabilities from reaching production environments.

# Article 3 Code Red: the Business Impact of Code Quality

Technical debt represents a significant business risk, sapping 23-42% of developers' productivity. Its effects extend beyond financial costs, affecting the well-being and job satisfaction of individuals.
One reason why this inefficiency persists is that code, being an abstract concept, isn't readily understandable to non-technical stakeholders, making it challenging to translate improvements in code quality into tangible business benefits.To address this, leverage a code health measure to both quantify and convey technical debt in a more accessible manner. Demonstrated to impact business outcomes such as time-to-market and the volume of unplanned work, code health offers a practical way to prioritize identified technical debt.Prioritizing this debt can be done by assessing the 'interest rate' through a Hotspot analysis, focusing on actionable and pertinent areas.By setting business expectations for enhancements in code quality—aimed at reducing development timelines and minimizing estimation uncertainties—the value of addressing technical debt becomes clear.

While functionality and correctness of code has traditionally been the main focus of computing educators, quality aspects of code are getting increasingly more attention. High-quality code contributes to the maintainability of software systems, and should therefore be a central aspect of computing education. We have conducted a systematic mapping study to give a broad overview of the research conducted in the field of code quality in an educational context. The study investigates paper characteristics, topics, research methods, and the targeted programming languages. We found 195 publications (1976-2022) on the topic in multiple databases, which we systematically coded to answer the research questions. This paper reports on the results and identifies developments, trends, and new opportunities for research in the field of code quality in computing education.
