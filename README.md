Clean code forms the bedrock of a sturdy and easily maintainable software system. It enhances legibility, promotes code reusability, simplifies debugging, and reduces technical obligations. Clean code doesn't just aid developers; it also exerts a favorable influence on project timelines, the scalability of the codebase, and team efficiency. Nonetheless, attaining and preserving clean code can be a formidable undertaking, particularly when projects become more intricate. This is where Exakat becomes invaluable.Exakat is a PHP-focused open-source static code analysis tool. It conducts thorough examinations of PHP codebases, detects possible problems, and provides practical suggestions for enhancing code excellence. Leveraging its wide array of analysis guidelines, Exakat empowers developers to uphold coding standards, pinpoint code issues, uncover security risks, and enhance performance.One of the key strengths of Exakat is its seamless integration with the DevOps workflow. It can be easily incorporated into continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines, allowing developers to catch code issues early in the development cycle. By integrating Exakat into the CI/CD process, teams can automate code reviews, enforce coding standards, and prevent potential bugs and vulnerabilities from reaching production environments.

# Article 3 Code Red: the Business Impact of Code Quality

Technical debt represents a significant business risk, sapping 23-42% of developers' productivity. Its effects extend beyond financial costs, affecting the well-being and job satisfaction of individuals.
One reason why this inefficiency persists is that code, being an abstract concept, isn't readily understandable to non-technical stakeholders, making it challenging to translate improvements in code quality into tangible business benefits.To address this, leverage a code health measure to both quantify and convey technical debt in a more accessible manner. Demonstrated to impact business outcomes such as time-to-market and the volume of unplanned work, code health offers a practical way to prioritize identified technical debt.Prioritizing this debt can be done by assessing the 'interest rate' through a Hotspot analysis, focusing on actionable and pertinent areas.By setting business expectations for enhancements in code quality—aimed at reducing development timelines and minimizing estimation uncertainties—the value of addressing technical debt becomes clear.
